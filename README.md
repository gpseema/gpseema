## About me

I am a Cognitive Scientist with a PhD from University of Hyderabad, India. I moved to Dresden, Germany with a Humboldt research fellowship in 2021. My main research interests are in the basic mechanisms behind attention, cognitive control and curiosity in humans. I have primarily been interested in understanding what kind of information people attend to and why. I have led and conducted several experimental studies measuring human behaviour, eye movements and brain activity. All of my research has been published in international peer-reviewed journals (20+) and presented at conferences across the world. I have considerable experience in coming up with research questions and writing grant/research proposals to fund my ideas.

All my projects and the associated study materials/code can be found on OSF: https://osf.io/zyqfm/

I write personal essays interspersed with ideas from cognitive science here: https://gpseema.substack.com/?utm_campaign=profile_chips
